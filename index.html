            Families are an integral part of one’s life. It does not matter if you have a small or big family, as long as you have one.
             A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. The basic knowledge about one’s culture and identity comes from their family only.
              In other words, you are a reflection of your family. All the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from their family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. 
              In my opinion, families are an essential part of one’s being. In this essay on my family, I will tell you why family is important.

            My family has been always by my side in ups and downs. They have taught me how to be a better person. 
            My family consists of four siblings and my parents. We also have a pet dog that is no less than our family.
            Within each family member, lies my strength. My mother is my strength as I can always count on her when I need a shoulder to cry on. 
            She believes in me more than any other person. She is the backbone of our family. My father is someone who will always hide away his troubles for the sake of his family.
            He has taught me the real meaning of strength. My siblings are my best friends on whom I can always fall back on.
